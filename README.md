## 📁 Contents

### 📘 Concepts Explained
Each section includes theory, LaTeX-rendered math, and a real-world analogy:

- **Machine Learning Overview**
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**

### 📊 Visualizations
- Graphs for model decision boundaries

 jupyter notebook
  ````
3. Or knit the RMarkdown file (.Rmd) using RStudio for formatted output.

📌 Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:
  
  ````bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
  ````
* For RMarkdown: R + `rmarkdown`, `knitr`, and LaTeX support

## Goal
